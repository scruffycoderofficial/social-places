  In order to manage reports
  As an Administrator
  I need to be able to create report shown records filtered by aggregation columns

  Scenario: Feature Background
    Given I login as administrator

  Scenario: Created report with one aggregation column filter
    Given I go to Reports & Segments / Manage Custom Reports
    When I click "Create Report"
    And fill "Report Form" with:
      | Name        | Test Report |
      | Entity      | User        |

      | First name |       | First Name |
      | Id         | Count | User Count |
    And add the following grouping columns:
      | First name |
    And add the following filters:
      | Field Condition    | First Name | is not empty |   |
      | Aggregation column | User Count | greater than | 1 |
    And save and close form
    Then I should see "Report saved" flash message

    And should see following grid:
      | First Name | User Count |
