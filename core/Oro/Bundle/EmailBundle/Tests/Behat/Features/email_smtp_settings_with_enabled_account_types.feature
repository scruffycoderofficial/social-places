  In order to manager Email setting of application
  As an Administrator
  I need to be able to check SMTP settings if additional account types is enabled

    And I login as administrator

  Scenario: Check SMTP settings in user configuration with correct parameters

    And I follow "System Configuration/General Setup/Email Configuration" on configuration sidebar

    And I should not see "Enable IMAP"
    And I should not see "Enable SMTP"
